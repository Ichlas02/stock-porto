Utilized calculated fields and parameters feature in Tableau to create:
1. Time period filters & custom parameters [1W, 1M, 3M, 6M, YTD (Year to Date), 1Y, 3Y, 5Y]
2. Stock filter for each sector
3. Latest market cap
4. First and last close price to calculate gain/loss based on the time period filter
5. Gain/Loss ranking to determine top gainer/loser
   
Made the dashboard using 5 sheets:
1. LQ45 (The main index graph)
2. Sectors (Visualize each stock graph in a sector)
3. Gain/Loss Persentage
4. Top Gainer
5. Top Loser
